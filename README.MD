Course Registration System 

Overview: 
This project utilizes the OOP paradigm to create a simpler version of the registration systems used at your universities. 

Course Registration System stores the following information about each course:
1. Course name
2. Course id
3. Maximum number of students registered in the course
4. Current number of registered students
5. List of names of students being registered in the given course
6. Course instructor
7. Course section number
8. Course location.

Course Registration System allows two users:
1. Admin 
2. Student 

Course Registration System allows the Admin to perform the following tasks: 

Courses Management
1. Create a new course
2. Delete a course
3. Edit a course (this will allow the admin to edit any information on the course except for course ID and name)
4. Display information for a given course (by course ID)
5. Register a student (this option will allow the admin to add a student without assigning to a course check Req 11 for student’s information – Hint: You might need to have an ArrayList of Students where you store Student objects)
6. Exit the system

Reports
1. View all courses (for every course the admin should be able to see the list of course name, course id, number of students registered, and the maximum number of students allowed to be registered)
2. View all courses that are FULL (reached the maximum number of students)
3. Write to a file the list of course that are Full
4. View the names of the students being registered in a specific course
5. View the list of courses that a given student is being registered on (given a student first name and last name the system shall display all the courses that students is being registered in)


Course Registration System allows the Student to perform the following tasks: 

Course Management
1. View all courses
2. View all courses that are not FULL
3. Register on a course 
4. Withdraw from a course
5. View all courses that the current student is being registered in
6. Exit

3. Now you can create students or edit the courses already in the system
